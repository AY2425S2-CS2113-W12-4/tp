# User Guide

## Introduction

Managing your finances has never been easier. MoneyTrail is a 
lightweight, user-friendly budget tracking application designed to 
help you keep track of your expenses, monitor your spending habits, 
and achieve your financial goals.

## Quick Start

Here are the steps to get started quickly:

1. Ensure that you have Java 17 or above installed.
2. Download the latest version of `MoneyTrail` from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2113-W12-4/tp/releases/download/v1.0/tp.jar).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the *home folder* for your application.
4. Open a command terminal, `cd`, into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar tp.jar` command to run the application.

## Features

> [!NOTE]
> Useful information about the command format:
> - Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
    e.g. in `find KEYWORD`, `KEYWORD` is a parameter which can be used as `find rent`.
> - Parameters must be in a **specific order** (except `edit` command).
    e.g. if the command specifies `c/CATEGORY d/DATE`, `d/DATE c/CATEGORY` is unacceptable.
> - **Extraneous parameters** for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list`) will generate an error.
    e.g. `list 123` is unacceptable.

- `c/CATEGORY`: Updates the entry's category.

- `d/DATE`: Updates the entry's date.

> [!NOTE]
> Useful information about the command format:
> - Parameters need not be in a **specific order**.
    e.g. if the command specifies `$/VALUE c/CATEGORY`, `c/CATEGORY $/VALUE` is acceptable.
> - Options need not be updated all at once. Users can select which options they want to update and leave the rest. 
> - However, INDEX must always come after `edit`, followed by DESCRIPTION.

Examples:

- `edit 1 $/20`

Outcome:
```
Entry updated. Expense: d/2021-03-04 $20.00 {food} [2025-09-04]

#### üìù Usage Notes
```bash
# Basic expense with required fields
addExp Textbook $/59.99

# With optional category
addExp Concert $/120.00 c/Entertainment

# With both optional fields
addExp Hotel $/200.00 c/Travel d/2023-12-15
```

### Known Issues

- Editing multiple fields at once may cause incorrect updates. Ensure that parameters are entered correctly to avoid data corruption.

- Application does not support undoing actions. Deleted or edited entries cannot be reverted.

- Special characters in descriptions may cause errors. Avoid using symbols like #, &, or @ in expense descriptions.

- Large datasets may slow down performance. If you have a significant number of entries, performance may degrade.

#### üîç Tips
- View entry numbers first with `list` before using `del`
- Amounts must be positive numbers (e.g. `$/15.50`)
- Dates should use `YYYY-MM-DD` format
