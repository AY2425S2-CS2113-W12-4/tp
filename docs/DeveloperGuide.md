## Design & implementation

{Describe the design and implementation of the product. Use UML diagrams and short code snippets where applicable.}

### Architecture Overview

Below is an overview of the main components and their interactions with one another:

The application is divided into several classes, each with a specific responsibility:
- `MoneyTrail`: The **main** class that initializes the application and handles user input.
- `MoneyList`: Manages the list of expenses and provides methods for adding, deleting, listing, and finding expenses.
- `Storage`: Handles loading and saving data to a file.
- `TextUI`: Manages user interface interactions, such as displaying messages and errors.
- `MTLogger`: Logs application events and errors for debugging and monitoring.
- `MTException`: A custom exception class for handling application-specific errors.
- `Expense`: Represents an expense entry with a description and amount.

NOTE: Additional classes may be required in the future.
